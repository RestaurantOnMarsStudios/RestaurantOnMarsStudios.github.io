### The Beginning

Restaurant On Mars Studios was founded on **June 23rd, 2018** by [Nicholas Bucher](http://www.nicholasbucher.com).



### Vision

The vision of Restaurant On Mars Studios is to make games that are **fun to both make and play**. 

My hope is that this vision is maintained, and ROMS meets the challenge of balancing **developer satisfaction** with **holistic game quality** as it grows as a company in the future.


### Company Motto

*We wish to inspire creativity in our patrons with a hearty menu of the finest cooked games, and plenty of to-go boxes!*



### Jekyll and Markdown
This website was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a free, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites where blog posts are written in the [Markdown Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). It is also hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a hosting service for static websites.
