Inspired by Neko Atsume, this is a casual game where you observe and improve a city block.

You swipe left and right to travel around the block, and can purchase upgrades, (like new shops or a fire hydrant, or public benches for a park). Events/natural disasters can occur, like fires, where purchasing a fire hydrant or having built a firefighter building would help you. Also, office spaces will improve your people's productivity, giving you more points (could be money or a made up currency). 

Alternatively, you could use a happiness points system, and focus on entertainment and comfort for the people. Then the happiness points could be used to purchase upgrades.

Each person in the city has their own backstory, and you can click on them to learn more. More people could arrive in your town as it expands, and each one could have a unique behaviour (shopping at a certain store regularly, going to a particular office every day, delivering mail, etc).

There could also be an overview page where you can switch locations if the game is expanded to multiple city blocks, or this could just be to see your city block in relation to the rest of the world. Optionally, you could also see the productivity/satisfaction of the people in your town on this page and how it changes as your town grows. This could be done by having speech or thought bubbles like in Persona 5, or by having a progress bar effect at the top of the screen.
