Starts out like a fishing game where you have to tap the screen with a certain timing to catch the fish.

But once you've caught a fish, it turns into a fishperson and you have to fight it!

When you lose against a fish, it disappears back into the lake. But fighting the fish is meant to be easy, and when you win, you get a fish trophy with it's backstory. There could be a wall of fishes that you get to decorate.

An in-game store could include different fishing rods, as well as different items (like frames, or wallpaper, or fake-fishtanks) to decorate your fish collection room. Tapping on a fish in the fish collection room would also bring up its backstory and picture.
