Inspired by MiniClips games. You play as a penguin, and you're catapulted through the air in a top down perspective.

While in the air you can tap the left side of the screen to dodge/move left, or the right side to dodge/move right. 
Pressing on the screen will make the screen dim as you power up, and then you get a boost (similar to boosting after a turn in Mario Kart)

Collectibles appear as points which you'll try to collect (could use these points in an in-game shop). And obstacles appear that the player will have to dodge. 

After some amount of time, the penguin falls to the ground and the game starts over. The length of time that it's in the air is determined by the catapult that you're using (new catapults or catapult upgrades can be bought in the shop).
