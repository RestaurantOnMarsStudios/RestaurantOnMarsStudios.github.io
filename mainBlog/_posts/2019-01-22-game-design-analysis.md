## Input and Output

There are two items of interest when talking about video game design - player input, and sensory output. 

### Input  

Input can be continuous (a phone accelerometer or joystick), or discrete (button presses). Touch controls can be discrete or continuous depending if the length of time the screen is held effects the input.

It is important to distinguish that discrete input methods provide simpler gameplay, while continuous input methods provide more complex gameplay. This relation can be established by examining movement in a game like Super Mario 64, where difficulty is introduced through platforming sections and enemy movement, versus a game like Pacman, where difficulty is introduced entirely through enemy movement. It is more difficult to navigate in Super Mario 64 since the player uses a joystick (continuous) to control Mario, whereas in Pacman, there is no variation in movement speed or direction beyond the buttons for up/down/left/right.



## Story Vs Gameplay


Video games almost always convey a story. Whether it is told through visual art style or a written narrative, this story gives the player a preconception about the game. 

Fused with the story is the gameplay, and how well the story and gameplay work together directly effects the quality and enjoyability of the entire game. This fusion of gameplay and story is where many games fail at creating an engaging experience. Other standout games use this relationship to great success. Some good examples are:

- Portal 2
  - The environment that you explore and solve puzzles in is also the environment that the story narrative takes place in.
  - The puzzle-solving gameplay makes sense because your character is meant to solve puzzles in the story narrative. Gameplay evolves and becomes more hectic as you progress. This evolution of gameplay reflects the story narrative as you explore more of the facility.
